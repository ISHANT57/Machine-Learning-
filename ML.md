# Machine Learning Overview

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence where machines learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed.

## Traditional Programming vs ML
Traditional Programming:
- Rules + Data → Output
- Logic written by humans

Machine Learning:
- Data + Output → Rules
- Logic learned by machine

## How Machine Learning Works
1. Collect data
2. Feed data to algorithm
3. Algorithm finds patterns
4. Model is trained
5. Model predicts new data

## Why Machine Learning is Needed
- Real-world problems are complex
- Writing rules manually is impossible
- Data-driven learning is more scalable
